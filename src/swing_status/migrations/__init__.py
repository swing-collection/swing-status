Hello Migrations Module
=======================

This module contains the database migration files for the Swing Hello
application. Migrations are used by Django to apply changes to the database
schema, such as  creating tables, adding fields, or modifying existing
structures.

Migrations are automatically generated and applied using Django's
`makemigrations` and `migrate` commands. They ensure that the database
schema stays in sync with the  models defined in the application.

This module typically includes:

- Initial migrations to set up the database schema for the application.
- Subsequent migrations to modify the schema as the application evolves.

For more information on Django migrations, see:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/

# Imports
# =============================================================================

# Standard import statements for Django migrations typically look like this:
# from django.db import migrations, models


# =============================================================================
# Module Exports
# =============================================================================

# This section is often left empty in migration files as they are not typically
# reused as modules in other parts of the application. However, for
# completeness:

# __all__ = []
